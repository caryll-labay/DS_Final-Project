# Ticketing System

## Project Overview
This project is a simple ticketing system developed as part of the **Data Structures and Algorithms** course. It was implemented in **C++** and utilizes **linear search** for seat allocation and retrieval. The system allows users to book, modify, search, and delete ticket reservations.

## Features
- **Menu-driven interface** for booking and managing tickets.
- **Seat selection** with predefined sections and pricing.
- **Linear search** implementation for finding booked seats.
- **Customer information management** (add, modify, search, delete).
- **File handling** for storing customer records persistently.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Data Structure Used:** Linear Search
- **File Handling:** Stores customer records in a text file

## How to Run the Program
1. Compile the C++ source file using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
   ```sh
   g++ Ticketing_system.cpp -o TicketingSystem
   ```
2. Run the compiled executable:
   ```sh
   ./TicketingSystem
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen menu to book, search, modify, or delete tickets.
